# socketio2-test-client
Very basic test client for socketio2

Single HTML file which allows you to connect to your server, listen for events (listed in the array eventType), and send arbitrary socketio events to the server.

Features:
* No frills
* Took less time to write than getting the fancy tools I found online working how I wanted
* Minimal engineering means you can change this very easily
